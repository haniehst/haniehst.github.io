#### AUTCup 2016
For AUTCup 2016, I developed an application based on **Qt** and **PyQt** framework. Each robotic league has its own page, and teams' list and their score in each level can be submitted.

#### AUTCup 2018
I completely redesigned the application for this competition. Instead of an offline qt application, it is a web application based on **beego** framework written in **Go** languages.
