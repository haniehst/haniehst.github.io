#### Introduction
A rectangular plate is considered as a playground in which 2 snakes move. The snakes will move in 4 main directions (up, down, left and right).
If the head of one of the snakes hits his body or the other snake, he loses the game, but if the head ends, the game will be equal.
Also, a snake hitting the edges of the ground leads to its loss.
The game server is based on a web socket and users will play the game through their browser.
Voice and video chat capabilities are also given to users during the game.
For this purpose, the browser must be allowed access to the webcam and microphone.(This option will be disabled if the user does not wish.)
